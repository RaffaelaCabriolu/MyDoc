<h1>How to write good support requests<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-write-good-support-requests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Writing good support requests is not only good for the support team, it is also
better for you! Due to us having lots of help requests, the time to understand
each problem is at a premium. The easier it is to understand yours, the faster
we will get to it.
Below is a list of good practices.</p>
<section id="never-send-support-requests-to-staff-members-directly">
<h2>Never send support requests to staff members directly<a class="headerlink" href="#never-send-support-requests-to-staff-members-directly" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Always send them to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:support&#37;&#52;&#48;metacenter&#46;no">support<span>&#64;</span>metacenter<span>&#46;</span>no</a> and staff members will pick them
up there. On <a class="reference external" href="mailto:support&#37;&#52;&#48;metacenter&#46;no">support<span>&#64;</span>metacenter<span>&#46;</span>no</a> they get tracked and have higher visibility.
Some staff members work on the support line only part time.
Sending the request to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:support&#37;&#52;&#48;metacenter&#46;no">support<span>&#64;</span>metacenter<span>&#46;</span>no</a> makes sure that somebody will pick
it up. Please note in the request that it is about Stallo, as there are more
clusters that are handled with this email address.</p>
</section>
<section id="do-not-manhandle-us-as-simple-let-me-google-that-for-you-assistants">
<h2>Do not manhandle us as simple “Let me Google that for you” assistants<a class="headerlink" href="#do-not-manhandle-us-as-simple-let-me-google-that-for-you-assistants" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Seriously: have you searched the internet with the exact error message and the
name of your application…? Other scientists may have had the very same problem
and might have been successful in solving it.
By the way: that’s almost always how we start to research, too…</p>
</section>
<section id="give-descriptive-subject">
<h2>Give descriptive subject<a class="headerlink" href="#give-descriptive-subject" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your subject line should be descriptive. “Problem on Stallo” is not a good
subject line since it could be valid for basically every support email we get.
The support staff is a team. The subjects are the first thing that we see. We
would like to be able to classify emails according to subjects before even
opening the email.</p>
</section>
<section id="include-actual-commands-and-error-messages">
<h2>Include actual commands and error messages<a class="headerlink" href="#include-actual-commands-and-error-messages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We cover this below, but it’s so important it needs to be mentioned at
the top, too: include the actual command you run and actual error
messages.  Copy and paste.  If you don’t include this, we will be
slightly annoyed and immediately ask this.</p>
<p>Please, do not screen shoot your ssh terminal and send us pictures (jpg, png, tiff…)
of what you saw on your monitor! From these, we would be unable to cut &amp; paste commands
or error messages, unnecessarily slowing down our research on your problem.
Your sample output does not need at all to “look good”, and we don’t need to know
what fancy ssh- or terminal software you have: a simple text-based cut &amp; paste directly
into the mail or ticket is the best we can work on with.</p>
</section>
<section id="new-problem-new-email">
<h2>New problem–new email<a class="headerlink" href="#new-problem-new-email" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Do not send support requests by replying to unrelated issues. Every issue gets a
number and this is the number that you see in the subject line. Replying to
unrelated issues means that your email gets filed under the wrong thread and
risks being overlooked.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-xy-problem">
<h2>The XY problem<a class="headerlink" href="#the-xy-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is a classic problem. Please read <a class="reference external" href="http://xyproblem.info">http://xyproblem.info</a>.  Often we know
the solution but sometimes we don’t know the problem.</p>
<p>In short (quoting from <a class="reference external" href="http://xyproblem.info">http://xyproblem.info</a>):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>User wants to do X.</p></li>
<li><p>User doesn’t know how to do X, but thinks they can fumble their way to a solution if they can just manage to do Y.</p></li>
<li><p>User doesn’t know how to do Y either.</p></li>
<li><p>User asks for help with Y.</p></li>
<li><p>Others try to help user with Y, but are confused because Y seems like a strange problem to want to solve.</p></li>
<li><p>After much interaction and wasted time, it finally becomes clear that the user really wants help with X, and that Y wasn’t even a suitable solution for X.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid the XY problem, if you struggle with Y but really what you are after
is X, please also tell us about X. Tell us what you really want to achieve.
Solving Y can take a long time.  We have had cases where after enormous effort
on Y we realized that the user wanted X and that Y was not the best way to
achieve X.</p>
</section>
<section id="tell-us-also-what-worked">
<h2>Tell us also what worked<a class="headerlink" href="#tell-us-also-what-worked" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Rather often we get requests of the type “I cannot get X to run on two nodes”.  The
request then does not mention whether it worked on one node or on one core or
whether it never worked and that this was the first attempt.
Perhaps the problem has even nothing to do with one or two nodes.
In order to better
isolate the problem and avoid wasting time with many back and forth emails,
please tell us what actually worked so far.  Tell us what you have tried to
isolate the problem.  This requires some effort from you but this is what we
expect from you.</p>
</section>
<section id="specify-your-environment">
<h2>Specify your environment<a class="headerlink" href="#specify-your-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Have you or your colleague compiled the code? Which modules were loaded?
If you use non-default modules and you do not tell us about it, we will
waste time when debugging with in a different environment.</p>
</section>
<section id="simple-cases-be-specific-include-commands-and-errors">
<h2>Simple cases: Be specific, include commands and errors<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-cases-be-specific-include-commands-and-errors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Whatever you do, don’t say that “X didn’t work”.  Exactly give the
commands you ran, environment (see above), and output error messages.
The actual error messages mean a lot - include all the output, it is
easy to copy and paste it.</p>
<p>The better you describe the problem the less we have to guess and ask.</p>
<p>Sometimes, just seeing the actual error message is enough to give an
useful answer.  For all but the simplest cases, you will need to make
the problem reproducible, which you should <em>always</em> try anyway.  See
the following points.</p>
</section>
<section id="complex-cases-create-an-example-which-reproduces-the-problem">
<h2>Complex cases: Create an example which reproduces the problem<a class="headerlink" href="#complex-cases-create-an-example-which-reproduces-the-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Create an example that we can ideally just copy paste and run and which
demonstrates the problem. It is otherwise very time consuming if the support
team needs to write input files and run scripts based on your possibly
incomplete description. See also next point.  Make this example available to
us. We do not search and read read-protected files without your permission.</p>
</section>
<section id="make-the-example-as-small-and-fast-as-possible">
<h2>Make the example as small and fast as possible<a class="headerlink" href="#make-the-example-as-small-and-fast-as-possible" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You run a calculation which crashes after running for one week. You are tempted
to write to support right away with this example but this is not a good idea.
Before you send a support request with this example, first try to reduce it.
Possibly and probably the crash can be reproduced with a much smaller example
(smaller system size or grid or basis set).  It is so much easier to schedule
and debug a problem which crashes after few seconds compared to a run which
crashes after hours.  Of course this requires some effort from you but this is
what we expect from you in order to create a useful support request.
Often when isolating the problem, the problem and solution crystallize before
even writing the support request.</p>
