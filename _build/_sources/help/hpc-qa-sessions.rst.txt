Forum, Open Question & Answer Sessions
======================================
Learn new tricks and ask & discuss questions 
--------------------------------------------

Meet the HPC staff, discuss problems and project ideas, give feedback or suggestions on how to improve services, and get advice for your projects.

Join us on `Zoom <https://uit.zoom.us/j/65284253551>`_, get yourself a coffee or tea and have a chat. It doesn’t matter from which institute or university you are, you are **welcome to join at any time**.

This time we will start with a **short seminar about “Helpful Tools & Services we offer you might not know about”**.
Afterwards we have the open question and answer session.

We can talk about:
- Problems/questions regarding the Stallo/Vilje shutdown and migration
- Questions regarding data storage and management
- Help with programming and software management
- Help with project organization and data management
- Anything else
If you think you might have a challenging question or topics for us, you can also send them to us before, so we can come prepared and help you better. If you have general or specific questions about the event: jorn.dietze@uit.no
