NTNU HPC Physics Documentation
==============================

This is the official documentation of the computational resources avalaible at the Physics Department of NTNU in Trondheim (IFY). 
This documentation is designed for students, researchers and staff members who are willing to use the computational facilities in IFY, and, it aims to create a support environment for any user that is willing to use those facilities.
The audience may be completely unaware of the High Performance Computing (HPC) concepts but must have some basic understanding of computers and computer programming.

If you have questions, special needs or problems, please contact us at the links in the section :doc:`/help/staff` and in the sections relative to the specific computing system.
