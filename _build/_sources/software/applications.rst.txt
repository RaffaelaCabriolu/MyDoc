Which software is installed on Stallo
=====================================

To find out what software packages are available, type::

  module avail


Changes in application software
-------------------------------

News about planned/unplanned downtime, changes in hardware, and important
changes in software will be published on the HPC UiT twitter account
`<https://twitter.com/hpc_uit>`_ and on the login screen of stallo.
For more information on the different situations see `news`.

The easiest way to check which software and versions available is to use
the  ``module`` command.
List all software available::

  module avail

List all version of a specific software::

  module avail software-name


Missing or new software
========================

If there is any software missing on this list that you would like to have
installed on Stallo, or you need help to install your own software, please
feel free to contact the support personal about this: support@metacenter.no.

If there is software missing on Stallo that you would like to have, there are
different options to install it:
* Use our installation framework EasyBuild
* Use a package manager like Conda or especially for bioinformatic software Bioconda
* Compile it yourself and install into your home directory
* Ask us to install for you

In this document we will show some ways of installing a new software.
If you run into problems, need help or have question, please
feel free to contact the support personal about this: support@metacenter.no.


Installing new software using EasyBuild
-----------------------------------------

Our building and installation framework, `EasyBuild <https://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Using_the_EasyBuild_command_line.html>`_ 
can be used by you to install software into your own home directory.
This is especially interesting for you if you need a software but it is probably
not used by other users of Stallo, so a systemwide installation doesn't make much sense.

To see if your software is available via the EasyBuild system have a look into the
`easyconfig github repository <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs>`_.
if you can find a version of your software there.
Alternatively use the search function of EasyBuild::

    eb -S REGEX

Let's assume you want to install the genome aligner Kraken2.
We find a easyconfig file with the name `Kraken2-2.0.7-beta-foss-2018b-Perl-5.28.0.eb <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/blob/master/easybuild/easyconfigs/k/Kraken2/Kraken2-2.0.7-beta-foss-2018b-Perl-5.28.0.eb>`_ 
in the easyconfig repository.

Before we start the installation process we first have to load the necessary modules::
  
  ml purge
  ml EasyBuild

Before we actually build we can check the building process by adding
`--dry-run-short` or `-D` to the build command::

  eb Kraken2-2.0.7-beta-foss-2018b-Perl-5.28.0.eb --dry-run-short

As you probably see, a long list of packages is printed with some packages being marked as missing. To automatically install all necessary dependencies we can add `--robot` and then 
run the installation::

  eb Kraken2-2.0.7-beta-foss-2018b-Perl-5.28.0.eb --robot

Before we can load your newly installed module, we have to add the path to the Lmod search path.
You might have to do this from time to time, or even every time you use your software, as your local cache is regularly updated. ::
 
  ml use ~/.local/easybuild/modules/all
  ml Kraken2/2.0.7


Conda/ Bioconda
-------------------

Many software packages, especially if they are python based, can be easily installed using
the Conda package manager.
For many bioinformatics software, Bioconda has become a nice solution.

A small tutorial can be found in the :ref:`python` section of this documentation.
